### My History

In 2014, I arrived in UK with my family as a refugee at the age of 15. It took us some time to settle and whilst the Home Office was assessing our case, I was not allowed to be in a school. So I started studying on my own, and I realised that I really like learning new languages - including programming languages. There is something very nice about syntax and structure that appeals to me. Within one year, I had become very proficient in English and programming languages like C, C++ and Python, and was able to comprehend Java code too as I never coded in Java until I started making android apps which began in 2016. After my family settled, I started voluntarily teaching mathematics, English and programming to young refugees within our community.

In 2015, I finished my GCSEs whilst volunteering part time in a photo studio near my house to gain some work experience and freelancing as a software/website developer (I still do freelancing). In the summer of that same year, I interned at a firm called [Validus Risk Management](https://validusrm.com). During this stint, I was able to show them my programming ability because of which I have interned there three times since then. I guess they liked my work ethics.

After the first stint with [Validus](https:validusrm.com) in 2015, I got into [Uxbridge College](https://www.uxbridgecollege.ac.uk) for my A-levels. Alongside studying I also started working part-time in SportsDirect as a sales assistant. I worked there for over 18 months, after which I left work to focus on my final exams. After the final exams, I received an offer to be an Assistant manager in a wholesale business which I freelanced to make a integrated system for their sale process. I accepted their offer on a trial basis because I was still considering going to university. During this time, I got accepted to study mathematics in a Foundation Year programme offered by [Lady Margaret Hall](https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk) - a college of University of Oxford. This gave me the opportunity to study under some of the best tutors in their respective fields. So I decided to leave that job and went there to study mathematics in this programme. After graduating from the Foundation Year programme, I moved on to study mathematics in [Lady Margaret Hall](https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk) as an undergraduate and I'm still there.
