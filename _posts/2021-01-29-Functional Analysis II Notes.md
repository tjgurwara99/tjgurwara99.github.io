            <strong> Definition: </strong>
            An inner (scalar) product in a linear vector space $X$ over $\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued function on $X \times X$, denoted as $\langle x, y \rangle$, 
            having the following properties:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong> Bilinearity: </strong> For a fixed $y$, $\langle x, y \rangle$ is a linear function of $x$, and for a fixed $x$,
                    $\langle x, y \rangle$ is a linear function of $y$.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Symmetry: </strong> $\langle x, y \rangle = \langle y, x \rangle$ for all $x, y \in X$.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Positivity: </strong> $\langle x, x \rangle > 0 $ for $x \neq 0$.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        If we have that $X$ is a linear vector space over $\mathbb{C}$ then 1. and 2. of the above defintion are replaced by:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong> Sesquilinearity: </strong> For a fixed $y$, $\langle x, y \rangle$ is a linear function of $x$, and for a fixed $x$, $\langle x, y \rangle$
                is a skewlinear function of $y$, i.e for all $x, y \in X$,
                $$
                    \langle ax, y \rangle = a \langle x y \rangle \ \text{and} \ \langle x, ay \rangle = \bar{a} \langle x, y \rangle
                $$
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> Skew symmetry: </strong> $\langle x, y \rangle = \overline{\langle y, x \rangle }$ for all $x, y \in X$.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> REMARK: </strong> We know that the inner product can generate a norm on the space, as follows:
            $$
                \| x \| = \langle x, x \rangle^{1/2}.
            $$ 
        </p>
    </details>

<li>
    <details> <summary> State the necessary theorem needed to prove that the norm generated by inner product is indeed a norm. </summary>
        <p>
            <strong> Theorem: </strong> (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality).
            For $x, y \in X$,
            $$
                | \langle x, y \rangle | \leq \| x \| \| y \|.
            $$
            Equality holds if and only if $x$ and $y$ are linearly dependent.
        </p>
        <details> <summary> <strong> Proof: </strong> </summary>
            <p>
                If $y = 0$, then the statement is trivially true.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, we assume that $y \neq 0$. Replacing $x$ by $ax$ with $|a| = 1$ so that $a \langle x, y \rangle$ is real, we may assume WLOG that
                $\langle x, y \rangle$ is real.
            </p>
            <p> 
                For $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we compute using sesquilinearity and skew symmetry:
                $$
                    \|x + ty \|^2 = \langle x + ty, x + ty \rangle = \| x \|^2 + 2t \mathrm{Re}\langle x, y \rangle + t^2 \| y \|^2.
                $$
            </p>
            <p>
                By positivity, this quadratic polynomial in $t$ is non-negative for all $t$. This implies that
                $$
                    (Re \langle x, y \rangle)^2 - \| x \|^2 \| y \|^2 \leq 0,
                $$
                which gives the desired inequality. If equality holds, then there is some $t_0$ such that $x + t_0y = 0$. Then the result follows.

    <details> <summary> Prove the norm that we define using the inner product indeed has the triangle inequality property. </summary>

            Easy to prove but try it later.

    <details> <summary> State the definition of Hilbert spaces. </summary>
        <p>
            <strong> Definition: </strong> An inner product space which is complete with the induced norm is called a Hilbert space.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> NOTE: </strong> Given an inner product space, one can complete it with respect to the induced norm. Since the inner product is a continuous function on its factors, it can be extended to a completed space. Hence the extended space is a Hilbert space.
